# Project setup

## Backend Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python package and environment management.

## Frontend Requirements

* Node.js (with `npm`).

## Installing dependancies

By default, the dependencies are managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), go there and install it.

From `./backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:
```console
$ poetry install
```
Then you can start a shell session with the new environment with:

```console
$ poetry shell
```
